# VevoTrending

Vevo Trending CLI App lists the top 20 trending videos on Vevo.com. Users can interact with the app via the command line. They have the ability to see 10 trending videos at a time, view all 20 trending videos at once and choose a specific video to see it's title and who the artist is. The name of the app is different from the actual website that data is being scraped from because I changed sites and it can be a pain to rename a repo.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vevo_trending'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install vevo_trending

## Usage

Download the project from GitHub. Use the Command Line (use Terminal for Mac OS or Command Prompt for Windows) and navigate into the project directory.

To start the Vevo Trending app, type the following line into your command line and follow the directions:

    $ bin/trending-videos
